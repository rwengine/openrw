## About

OpenRW is a cross-platform, open source re-implementation of Rockstar Games'
Grand Theft Auto III, a classic 3D action game first published in 2001.
OpenRW has been ported to Linux, macOS, Windows, and several variants of BSD.

A legitimate copy of the original PC game is required to run OpenRW. Without
this it will not be possible to play.
