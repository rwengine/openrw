# Locate SDL2 library
# This module defines:
# - SDL2_LIBRARY, the name of the library to link against
# - SDL2_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to SDL2
# - SDL2_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find SDL.h
# and creates:
# - SDL2::SDL2 imported target
#
# This module responds to the the flag:
# SDL2_BUILDING_LIBRARY
# If this is defined, then no SDL2_main will be linked in because
# only applications need main().
# Otherwise, it is assumed you are building an application and this
# module will attempt to locate and set the the proper link flags
# as part of the returned SDL2_LIBRARY variable.
#
# SDL2_STATIC
# If this is defined, this module will search for static libraries.
# On Windows, it is uncertain whether a .lib belongs to a dynamic or static SDL2 build.
#
# Don't forget to include SDL2main.h and SDL2main.m your project for the
# OS X framework based version. (Other versions link to -lSDL2main which
# this module will try to find on your behalf.) Also for OS X, this
# module will automatically add the -framework Cocoa on your behalf.
#
# $SDL2DIR is an environment variable that would
# correspond to the ./configure --prefix=$SDL2DIR
# used in building SDL2.
# l.e.galup  9-20-02
#
# Modified by Eric Wing.
# Added code to assist with automated building by using environmental variables
# and providing a more controlled/consistent search behavior.
# Added new modifications to recognize OS X frameworks and
# additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc).
# Also corrected the header search path to follow "proper" SDL2 guidelines.
# Added a search for SDL2main which is needed by some platforms.
# Added a search for threads which is needed by some platforms.
# Added needed compile switches for MinGW.
#
# On OSX, this will prefer the Framework version (if found) over others.
# People will have to manually change the cache values of
# SDL2_LIBRARY to override this selection or set the CMake environment
# CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH to modify the search paths.
#
# Note that the header path has changed from SDL2/SDL.h to just SDL.h
# This needed to change because "proper" SDL2 convention
# is #include "SDL.h", not <SDL2/SDL.h>. This is done for portability
# reasons because not all systems place things in SDL2/ (see FreeBSD).
#
# Ported by Johnny Patterson. This is a literal port for SDL2 of the FindSDL.cmake
# module with the minor edit of changing "SDL" to "SDL2" where necessary. This
# was not created for redistribution, and exists temporarily pending official
# SDL2 CMake modules.
